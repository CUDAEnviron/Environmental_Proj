# Technology use for Climate Change project

## Overview 
For this project we will use various forms of technology to accomplish the task of showing 
that there is a direct correlation between global temerature increase and an abundance of CO2 
levels. To do so, we will analyze the data from csv data sets that include:an extensive collection of global temperature data and Carbon Dioxide(CO2) emissions on Gross Domestic Product(GDP) by country and/or region.
