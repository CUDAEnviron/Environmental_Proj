# Technology use for Climate Change project

## Overview 

For this project we will use various forms of technology to accomplish the task of showing 
that there is a direct correlation between global temerature increase and an abundance of CO2 
levels. To do so, we will analyze the data from csv data sets that include: an extensive collection of global temperature data and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by country and/or region. We will use  to detect and correct any discrepancy in the data before fitting it into our machine learning model. 

## Python -- Jupyter Notebook 

Using PythonData, we have imported the pandas library to 

## SQL Database 

## Machine Learning Model 

## Tableau
