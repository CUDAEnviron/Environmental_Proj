# Environmental Project

## Database Storage

- We are using a Postgres SQL database hosted by Heroku for our project.

- Our first base data file is Resources/<b>owid-co2-data.csv</b> and has 24016 rows and 38 columns.

- This file has been uploaded to the <b>co2_data</b> table in the Postgres database.<br>

- We will be processing this data and adding other sets of data as we continue to develop this project.
